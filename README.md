# WebWizard
This project was originally created using a private versioning server, I am now making it public for portfolio purposes.

Please refer to the user-manual.pdf file for installation and usage instructions after cloning the project.

WebWizard is a website creation tool built using the CodeIgniter framework. 

The goal of the project was to create a tool which is easy to use and exports high quality, reusable code. The application can create fully responsive websites using pre-made bootstrap 'blocks'. The drag and drop interface is based on the bootstrap starter kit application available here: bootstrapstarterkit.com/bskit-demo/.
